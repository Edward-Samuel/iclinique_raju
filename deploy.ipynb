      "The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores).\n",
      "Symptoms of anal cancer can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)\n",
      "itching and pain around the anus\n",

      "loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some people with anal cancer don’t have any symptoms. \n",
      "Speak to your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they’re unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.\n",
      "Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.\n",
      "They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary. \n",
      "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its 2015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks.\n",
      "If you’re referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.\n",
      "Some of the tests you may have include a:\n",
      "\n",
      "sigmoidoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities\n",
      "proctoscopy – where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end\n",
      "biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope \n",
      "\n",
      "If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.\n",
      "You can read more about the stages of anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.\n",
      "If you’re diagnosed with anal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.\n",
      "The main treatments used for anal cancer are:\n",
      "\n",
      "chemoradiation – a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy\n",
      "surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where the cancer has spread and can’t be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as palliative care.\n",
      "Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). It’s currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don’t usually need to stay in hospital when you’re having chemoradiation.\n",
      "Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in 2 cycles, each lasting 4 to 5 days, with a 4-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished.\n",
      "The tube means you don’t need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.\n",
      "A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC.\n",
      "Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out\n",
      "Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for 5 to 6 weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required.\n",
      "Read more about how radiotherapy is carried out\n",
      "Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "tiredness\n",
      "sore skin around the anus\n",
      "sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women\n",

      "feeling sick\n",
      "diarrhoea\n",
      "\n",
      "These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. If you’re concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins. \n",
      "Other possible long-term side effects can include:\n",

      "bowel control problems\n",
      "long-term (chronic) diarrhoea\n",

      "\n",
      "Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.\n",
      "Surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. It’s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn’t worked.\n",
      "If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days.\n",
      "If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.\n",
      "An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.\n",
      "During the operation, a permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.\n",
      "Before and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.\n",
      "Read more about living with a colostomy\n",
      "After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\n",
      "To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually become less frequent over time.\n",
      "The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) – a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body\n",
      "having anal sex or lots of sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV\n",
      "having a history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancer\n",
      "smoking\n",
      "having a weakened immune system – for example, if you have HIV\n",
      "\n",

      "The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.\n",
      "The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).\n",
      "However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.\n",

      "There are a range of exercises which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. These are known as airway clearance techniques. They can often help coughing and breathlessness.\n",
      "You can be referred to a physiotherapist who can teach you these techniques.\n",
      "Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) involves you repeating a cycle made up of different steps. For example, a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up. Then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.\n",
      "Do not attempt ACBT if you haven’t first been taught the steps by a physiotherapist. Doing it incorrectly could damage your lungs.\n",
      "If you’re otherwise healthy, you’ll probably only need to do ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to do it more.\n",
      "Changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage. The steps are usually done with the help of a physiotherapist or carer.\n",

      "Recovering fully from a bronchiectasis exacerbation can take months.\n",
      "If your symptoms are more severe, you may need to go to hospital for antibiotic injections.\n",
      "If you have 3 or more infections in a year, or your symptoms during infection are very severe, you may be given antibiotics on a long-term basis.\n",
      "Occasionally, medication breathed in through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended. This makes it easier to clear your lungs.\n",

      "\n",
      "worksheets\n",

      "The main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. CBT helps to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how you think about food, eating, and weight.\n",
      "One alternative to CBT is interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT explores the way you interact with other people. It also looks at the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.\n",
      "Learn more about talking therapies\n",
      "Antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. They can reduce the urges to binge and vomit.\n",
      "The medication will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually start on a low dose. The dose will gradually increase as your body adjusts to the medicine.\n",
      "Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It’s best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.\n",
      "Recovery from bulimia can take a long time. It’s common for bulimia symptoms to return after treatment. This is often called a relapse, and is more likely during times of stress. If relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same. The first step is going to your GP.\n",
      "There are physical complications associated with bulimia.\n",
      "These can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "dental problems – regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay\n",
      "repeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a sore throat\n",

      "If you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile. While it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.\n",
      "If you have diabetes, you’ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "People with bulimia can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean making changes to their eating habits.\n",
      "If you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:\n",
      "\n",
      "talking to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family\n",
      "going to see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia, you can offer help and support.\n",
      "You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\n",
      "You could speak to your own GP or a healthcare professional if you’d like some advice on how to help someone.\n",

      "A carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.\n",
      "Otherwise, people usually speak to their GP after they have developed symptoms. A carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an endoscopy.\n",
      "If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).\n",
      "You can read more about the surgery for carcinoid tumours on the Cancer Research UK website.\n",
      "If the tumour cannot be removed, but it’s not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored. \n",

      "chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms\n",

      "If you have diarrhoea, it’s important to keep drinking little and often to avoid dehydration.\n",
      "If the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.\n",
      "Overall, people with carcinoid tumours have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers. Many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.\n",
      "But as the tumour grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. You may need further surgery or other treatments.\n",
      "Unfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won’t usually be possible to remove all of it. However, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.\n",

      "After 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.\n",
      "New spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.\n",

      "Nifedipine can help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken to stop them developing.\n",
      "Chilblains are caused by an abnormal reaction to the cold. They’re common in the UK because the weather is damp and cold in the winter.\n",
      "Some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter.\n",
      "When the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider. If this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow.

      "Some people also experience symptoms of nausea and vomiting during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.\n",
      "Although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there’s often no trigger.\n",
      "Eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.\n",
      "Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.\n",
      "Additional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.\n",

      "The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.\n",

      "C. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.\n",

      "When this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person’s diarrhoea.\n",

      "Sometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason.\n",
      "If your doctor thinks that you have DVT, you will need to have some tests. These include a specific blood test called a D dimer, and/or an ultrasound. An ultrasound scan shows if blood is flowing normally through the veins or if there are any clots.\n",
      "You may also need an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you’ll be injected with a dye to show where the clot is.\n",
      "There are a few ways to treat DVT. Your healthcare team will decide the best way to treat your symptoms.\n",
      "Anticoagulant medicines are used to treat DVT. These can include warfarin or apixaban.\n",
      "Anticoagulants are often referred to as “blood-thinning” medicines, but they don’t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.\n",
      "You may need to take an anticoagulant medicine like warfarin for at least 3 months.\n",
      "You’ll be prescribed compression socks to treat DVT. These are knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation.\n",
      "Compression socks can improve the symptoms of DVT, including pain and swelling. They can also help to prevent complications of DVT.\n",
      "Once you’ve been prescribed compression socks, your healthcare team may advise you to walk regularly. This can help to prevent symptoms of DVT and reduce or prevent complications.\n",
      "Some people may need surgery to treat DVT.\n",
      "You may need to be fitted with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to treat your symptoms. These are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They can be used to help prevent blood clots developing.\n",
      "If you have DVT in your leg, you may be advised to raise it whenever you’re resting. This helps to relieve pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf.\n",
      "When raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. To do this, you can put a cushion underneath your leg whilst you’re lying down.\n",
      "You can help reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle.\n",
      "Find out more about healthy living\n",
      "If you need to go into hospital for surgery, your healthcare team will assess your risk of developing DVT.\n",
      "If you’re at risk of developing DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it. For example, you may need to wear compression socks or take medicine.\n",
      "You may need to continue these treatments after you leave hospital as there’s still a risk that you could develop DVT.\n",
      "Whilst in hospital, try to move as much as you can. Your healthcare team may give you exercises to do.\n",
      "If you need to travel a long distance, or for more than 3 hours, there are steps you can take to help avoid getting DVT.\n",
      "You should:\n",
      "\n",
      "drink plenty of water\n",
      "practice some leg exercises, such as flexing your ankles\n",

      "Speak to a healthcare professional if you’re planning any long-distance travel and have had DVT in the past, or if you’re at risk of it.\n",
      "DVT can be very serious as blood clots can travel to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs to be treated quickly.\n",
      "If you’ve had a DVT, you can develop long-term symptoms like pain and swelling. This is known as post-thrombotic syndrome.\n",

      "Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.\n",
      "The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).\n",
      "When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it’s broken down to produce energy.\n",

      "In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body’s organs.\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.\n",
      "If you’re diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you’ll need insulin injections for the rest of your life.\n",

They will look at your vulva, vagina and cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) using a speculum (medical instrument).

      "The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.\n",
      "The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.\n",
      "The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).\n",
      "Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\n",
      "People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.\n",
      "Seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep.\n",
      "The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:\n",
      "\n",
      "focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected\n",
      "generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected\n",
      "\n",
      "Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.\n",
      "There are two main types of focal seizure.\n",
      "There are 6 main types of generalised seizure.\n",
      "Myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.\n",
      "If you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure.\n",
      "If you’re with someone who has a seizure:\n",
      "\n",
      "protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby\n",
      "cushion their head with your hands or soft material\n",
      "do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger)\n",
      "don’t put anything in their mouth\n",
      "stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness\n",
      "\n",
      "When the convulsions have stopped, put them into the recovery position until they’ve recovered.\n",
      "Status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.\n",
      "You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. It’s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.\n",
      "If you’ve been trained to treat the condition, you’ll usually have been advised to use either:\n",
      "\n",
      "a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person’s cheek or up their nose (this is the most common immediate treatment)\n",
      "a medication called diazepam that’s placed in the person’s rectum (less commonly used)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, phone 999 for an ambulance.\n",

      "Symptoms of Erectile dysfunction (impotence):\n",
      "The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.\n",
      "ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.\n",
      "Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.\n",
      "In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.\n",
      "See your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).\n",
      "Many websites offer treatments for ED but their use is not recommended. The medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. Even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you.\n",
      "It is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you.\n",

      "Symptoms of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:\n",
      "Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.\n",
      "People usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.\n",
      "These symptoms can last up to 2 weeks.\n",
      "A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include:\n",
      "\n",
      "peeing less\n",
      "tiredness\n",
      "swelling\n",
      "bruising\n",
      "\n",
      "This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years.\n",
      "Some people become infected but don’t develop symptoms.\n",
      "Further information about gastroenteritis\n",
      "There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment.\n",
      "It’s important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration.\n",
      "Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications.\n",
      "Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin.\n",
      "Find out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected.\n",
      "Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours.\n",
      "Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better.\n",
      "Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school.\n",
      "If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has.\n",
      "If you have a child under 5 years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery.\n",
      "Children under 5 years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others.\n",

      "Symptoms of Ewing sarcoma:\n",
      "The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.\n",
      "The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.\n",
      "Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.\n",
      "In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.\n",
      "Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown.\n",
      "As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones.\n",
      "The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.\n",
      "Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma. \n",
      "However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.\n",
      "The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer.\n",
      "When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they’ll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.\n",
      "Your GP may refer you for an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).\n",
      "They may recommend that you have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to examine the area in closer detail.\n",
      "A bone biopsy may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic.\n",
      "The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer.\n",
      "Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\n",
      "Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.\n",
      "Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.\n",
      "Ewing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.\n",
      "In some cases, surgically removing Ewing’s sarcoma can be difficult – for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.\n",
      "If surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on:\n",
      "\n",
      "the size of the tumour\n",
      "where it is in your body\n",
      "whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection.\n",
      "Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.\n",
      "In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.\n",
      "For more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website.\n",
      "If you’re diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions.\n",
      "The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure.\n",
      "However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement.\n",
      "It’s important to seek help and talk about how you’re feeling. You could talk to your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment.\n",
      "There are also a number of practical issues you’ll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work.\n",
      "The Cancer Research UK website has more information on coping with bone cancer.\n",
      "If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n",

      "pain in or around your eye, although this is rare\n",
      "\n",
      "These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they’re not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it’s important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible.\n",
      "Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it’s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.\n",
      "Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.\n",
      "It can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.\n",
      "Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\n",
      "It’s not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:\n",
      "\n",
      "lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes\n",
      "white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin\n",
      "unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you’re more at risk of developing skin cancer and eye melanoma\n",
      "use of sunbeds – there’s some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma\n",
      "overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their fifties.\n",
      "If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment.\n",
      "If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they’ll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow.\n",
      "It’s likely you’ll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities\n",
      "an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size\n",
      "a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.\n",
      "Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.\n",
      "Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.\n",
      "The main treatments for eye melanoma are:\n",
      "\n",
      "brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells\n",
      "external radiotherapy – a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells\n",
      "surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye\n",
      "removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you’ve lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye\n",

      "Symptoms of Frozen shoulder:\n",
      "Pain and persistent stiffness in the shoulder joint are the two main symptoms of a frozen shoulder.\n",
      "This makes it painful and difficult to carry out the full range of normal shoulder movements. You may find it difficult to perform everyday tasks, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "bathing\n",
      "dressing\n",
      "driving\n",
      "sleeping comfortably\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms vary from mild, with little difference to daily activities, to severe, where it may not be possible to move your shoulder at all.\n",
      "The symptoms of a frozen shoulder usually get worse gradually, over a number of months.\n",
      "There are three separate stages to the condition but sometimes these stages may be difficult to distinguish. The symptoms may also vary greatly from person to person.\n",
      "During stage one, often referred to as the “freezing” phase, your shoulder starts to ache and can become very painful, for example, when reaching out for things.\n",
      "The pain is often worse at night and when you lie on the affected side. This stage can last anywhere from 2-9 months.\n",
      "Stage two is often known as the “frozen” phase. Your shoulder may become increasingly stiff, but the pain doesn’t usually get worse and may even decrease.\n",
      "The stiffness in your shoulder can continue to affect your day to day activities. This stage usually lasts 4-12 months.\n",
      "Stage three is known as the “thawing” phase. During this period, you’ll gradually regain movement in your shoulder.\n",
      "If pain is still present it should start to fade, although it may come back occasionally as the stiffness eases. This stage can last 12 months or more.\n",
      "In order for a frozen shoulder to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\n",
      "They’ll initially ask you questions about your shoulder issue and then carry out a physical examination. This will include checking your range of movement and strength.\n",
      "You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\n",
      "Treatment options depend on the severity of your symptoms. Although, most cases improve on their own, some cases can take over a year to resolve.\n",
      "During the painful phase the emphasis is on pain relief. Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.\n",

      "Corticosteroid Injections\n",
      "If painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your shoulder joint.\n",
      "Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.\n",
      "Injections won’t cure your condition or reduce shoulder stiffness, they are used to help with the pain.\n",
      "Read more about corticosteroids\n",
      "A frozen shoulder can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\n",
      "You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\n",
      "Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\n",

      "However, there’s still a lot of research to be done to understand how and why FND happens.\n",
      "FND can happen for a wide range of reasons. There’s often more than one reason, and the reasons can vary hugely from person to person.\n",
      "Some of the reasons why the brain stops working properly in FND include:\n",
      "\n",
      "the brain trying to get rid of a painful sensation\n",
      "a migraine or other neurological symptom\n",
      "the brain shutting down a part or all of the body in response to a situation it thinks is threatening\n",
      "\n",
      "In some people, stressful events in the past or present can be relevant to FND. In others, stress is not relevant.\n",
      "The risk of developing FND increases if you have another neurological condition.\n",
      "Read more about how and why FND happens.\n",
      "When diagnosing FND, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of FND.\n",
      "Your healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing FND. This is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, FND is present alongside another neurological condition. Someone can have both FND and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (MS).\n",
      "The diagnosis of FND, however, should be given because you have the clinical features of FND. It shouldn’t be given just because there’s no evidence of other conditions or illnesses.\n",
      "Because the symptoms of FND are not always there, your healthcare provider may ask you to video your symptoms. This will allow them to see what your symptoms look like.\n",
      "FND is a really variable condition. Some people have quite short-lived symptoms. Others can have them for many years.\n",
      "There are treatments available that can manage and improve FND. These treatments are all forms of rehabilitation therapy, which aims to improve your ability to carry out every day activities. Many of these treatments are designed to ‘retrain the brain’. Some people with FND benefit a lot from treatment and may go into remission. Other people continue to have FND symptoms despite treatment.\n",
      "Read more about treating FND\n",
      "FND is broadly the same condition in children and young people. It’s unusual for it to occur under the age of 10. It becomes more common through the teenage years.\n",
      "The treatment for FND in children and young people is similar to adults. It’s especially important for families and schools to learn about the condition, so they can respond in the most helpful way.\n",
      "If you’ve been diagnosed with FND there are sources of information, charities and support groups that can help you.\n",

      "Most people with the herpes virus don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.\n",
      "If you do get symptoms, it takes usually 2 to 12 days after contact for them to appear. Some people don’t get symptoms until months or sometimes years later.\n",
      "Once you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If this happens, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a ‘recurrent episode’ of genital herpes.\n",
      "This first episode of genital herpes may last from 2 to 4 weeks.\n",
      "Repeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode.\n",

      "The genital herpes swab tests are very reliable, though if the ulcer is too dry then it may be less likely to find a positive result.\n",
      "Genital herpes can be treated with antiviral medication.\n",

      "by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes\n",

      "Sometimes herpes can be passed on when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called ‘asymptomatic shedding’.\n",
      "This risk goes down during the first months after you catch herpes and is not likely after two years. However, it is more common when people are still having frequent recurrences.\n",
      "Very rarely, herpes is passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is only likely to happen if a mother has her first episode of herpes after week 26 of the pregnancy. When women have had herpes longer than three months, normal delivery is expected even if there are symptoms at the time of delivery.\n",

      "Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\n",
      "The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.\n",

      " Symptoms like aching, cramping, tingling, heaviness and occasional weakness in the legs are usually brought on by walking or standing. They can be eased by sitting or leaning forward.\n",
      "Patients with lumbar stenosis can also have back pain. However, low back pain with no leg symptoms is usually not thought to be caused by stenosis.  \n",
      "Lumbar stenosis is a long term condition, and symptoms are often variable from day to day.  Many patients have found that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life. \n",
      "In order for lumbar stenosis to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\n",
      "They’ll ask you questions about your back issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.\n",
      "You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\n",
      "As we get older, aging in the spine can cause narrowing and a reduction of space for the spinal nerves leading to irritation. Even then, nerves are resilient and can learn how to cope with this narrower tunnel.  \n",
      "Clinicians may call the condition “central stenosis” or “foraminal stenosis”, depending on where the changes in your spine have happened.  \n",
      "Rarely spinal stenosis can cause a condition called Cauda Equina Syndrome to develop. This is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.\n",
      "Many people can cope with their stenosis with a combination of time, modifying activity, and pacing themselves to allow the nerves to adapt.\n",
      "If your symptoms are relieved by bending or leaning forward, many people find it helpful to have regular breaks when walking like taking a seat or leaning against a wall. If you’re struggling with your walking it may be helpful to talk to a healthcare professional about a walking aid or support.\n",
      "Pain medication, staying active, and gentle exercise may also help.\n",
      "The following can help to reduce the pain:\n",
      "\n",
      "pain medication – this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery\n",
      "heat or ice packs\n",
      "\n",
      "More about taking painkillers.\n",
      "In some cases, surgery may be an option if symptoms are not improving and all other treatment options have been tried. The operation, called spinal decompression, involves reducing the pressure on the nerves affected by stenosis.\n",
      "A back problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\n",
      "You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\n",
      "Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\n",
      "You should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.\n",
      "If your back problem hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\n",

      "In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.\n",
      "If lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.\n",

      "If you test positive for chlamydia, and your symptoms suggest that you might have LGV, the lab will do a further test for LGV.\n",
      "The test for LGV is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. This can take up to 3 weeks.\n",
      "The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:\n",
      "\n",
      "using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus\n",
      "urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed\n",
      "\n",
      "Your partner (s) for the past 3 months should also be tested for LGV.\n",
      "Antibiotics will treat the LGV infection.\n",
      "The result of the LGV test can take 3 weeks to come back, so your doctor may advise you to start treatment before the final result is available.\n",
      "If left untreated, LGV can cause scarring and swelling of the skin. It can also cause permanent swelling of the genitals. Rectal infection can also cause swelling and scarring resulting in the risk of long-term bowel complications. Rarely the infection may spread via the bloodstream causing inflammation of the joints or liver.\n",
      "To avoid passing LGV on to your partner(s) you should avoid having sex until both you and your partner have finished your treatment.\n",
      "You can get LGV by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom).\n",
      "Your risk of getting LGV may be increased by:\n",
      "\n",
      "chemsex\n",
      "having group sex\n",
      "fisting\n",
      "sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used\n",

      "It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you’re travelling to areas where there’s a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.\n",
      "Symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.\n",

      "Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.\n",
      "There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.\n",
      "All malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It’s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.\n",
      "The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.\n",
      "When a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person.\n",
      "When an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.\n",
      "Although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions and sharing needles.\n",
      "Malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.\n",
      "The fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries.\n",
      "Malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.\n",
      "The destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe anaemia.\n",
      "Anaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body’s muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.\n",
      "In rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.\n",
      "Other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:\n",
      "\n",
      "liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\n",
      "shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure\n",

      "These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos.\n",

      "fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed\n",
      "a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed\n",
      "\n",
      "These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.\n",
      "The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.\n",
      "As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care.\n",
      "Possible treatments include:\n",
      "\n",
      "chemotherapy – this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer\n",
      "radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control\n",
      "surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain.\n",
      "Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you.\n",

      "Placing a warm cloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain.\n",
      "Antibiotics are not usually used to treat middle ear infections.\n",
      "Most middle ear infections occur when an infection, such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear. This causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. The mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.\n",
      "An enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it often causes ear infections.\n",

      "However, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems.\n",
      "Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement.\n",
      "Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected.\n",
      "Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).\n",
      "Compression of the spinal cord can cause pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.\n",
      "Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.\n",
      "If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.\n",
      "People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness).\n",
      "You may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.\n",
      "A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.\n",
      "Symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme thirst, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently, constipation, confusion and drowsiness.\n",
      "Bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage) – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.\n",
      "In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, bleeding from the gums or nose, and shortness of breath.\n",
      "Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by the cancer cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also cause kidney damage.\n",

      "Symptoms of Multiple sclerosis (MS):\n",
      "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently.\n",
      "The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people’s symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go.\n",
      "Periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions.\n",
      "Some of the most common symptoms include:\n",
      "MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it.\n",
      "In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body.\n",
      "The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\n",
      "These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.\n",
      "When the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.\n",
      "Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn’t known. It’s not caused by anything you’ve done and it’s not clear if you can prevent it.\n",
      "It’s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition.\n",

      "More research will help us understand why MS occurs and whether it can be prevented or not.\n",
      "It can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. You may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.\n",
      "If your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.\n",
      "Some of the tests you may need to confirm MS are:\n",

      "neurological examination\n",
      "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n",
      "lumbar puncture\n",
      "blood test\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have a diagnosis of MS, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of MS you have – either relapsing remitting MS or primary progressive MS.\n",
      "This will largely be based on:\n",
      "\n",
      "the pattern of your symptoms – like whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress)\n",
      "the results of an MRI scan\n",
      "\n",
      "It can take some time to find out which type of MS you have because the symptoms are so varied. It can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive MS, as the condition usually worsens slowly.\n",
      "Although there isn’t a cure for MS, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs.\n",
      "These reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses.\n",
      "These treatments reduce the chances of developing progressive symptoms of MS. They might also help to slow worsening disability in MS.\n",
      "Disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They’re only prescribed to those with either:\n",
      "\n",
      "relapsing remitting MS\n",
      "secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they’ve had\n",
      "primary progressive MS who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an MRI scan\n",
      "\n",
      "People without relapses are less likely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them.\n",

      "Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.\n",
      "In most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.\n",
      "In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.\n",
      "It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.\n",
      "Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.\n",
      "External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won’t need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments.\n",
      "In some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.\n",
      "Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.\n",
      "Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "red and sore skin in the treatment area\n",
      "feeling sick\n",
      "changes to your sense of taste\n",

      "Chemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.\n",
      "It’s usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight during treatment.\n",

      "NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don’t always pick up NAFLD.\n",
      "The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.\n",
      "If you’re diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.\n",
      "Most people with NAFLD won’t develop any serious problems, but if you’re diagnosed with the condition it’s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.\n",

      "Lose weight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it.\n",
      "Eat a healthy diet – try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too.\n",
      "Exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don’t lose weight.\n",
      "Stop smoking – if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\n",

      "Symptoms of Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD):\n",
      "OCD affects people differently. It usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.\n",
      "This pattern has 4 main steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Obsession – where an intrusive, distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind.\n",
      "Anxiety – the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress.\n",
      "Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel you have to do as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession.\n",
      "Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief, but the obsession and anxiety return, causing the cycle to begin again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.\n",
      "Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.\n",
      "If you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.\n",
      "Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:\n",
      "\n",
      "fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you\n",
      "fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on\n",
      "fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance\n",
      "a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way\n",
      "\n",
      "Compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.\n",
      "For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.\n",
      "Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.\n",
      "Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.\n",
      "Some people with OCD may also have or develop other mental health problems, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "depression\n",
      "eating disorders\n",
      "generalised anxiety disorder\n",

      "Symptoms of Obstructive sleep apnoea:\n",
      "Signs of OSA can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "being very sleepy during the day\n",
      "breathing pauses through the night – this may be noticed by a partner, friend or relative\n",
      "loud snoring\n",
      "noisy and/or laboured breathing\n",
      "repeated periods where breathing stops or is interrupted by gasping or snorting\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up often during the night to pee.\n",
      "During an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness. Your airway then reopens and you can breathe normally. These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired and more likely to fall asleep during the day. You’ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.\n",
      "They can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and may refer you to a sleep specialist.\n",
      "Before seeing your GP it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to watch you while you’re asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot breathing pauses.\n",
      "It may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This asks how likely it is for you to doze off in different situations. For example, watching TV, sitting in a meeting or while driving. The final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.\n",
      "Your GP will usually ask questions about your symptoms. They may also take your blood pressure and a blood sample. This can help to rule out other conditions that may explain your tiredness. For example, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or anaemia.\n",
      "The next step will usually be an assessment through the night (sleep study). Your sleeping pattern will be checked to find whether or not you have a high number of breathing pauses through the night. It’s common to have breathing pauses through the night but a high number is abnormal. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help investigate and treat people with sleep disorders.\n",
      "The sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.\n",
      "This may include measuring your height and weight to work out your body mass index (BMI), as well as measuring your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA.\n",
      "The sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight. This can be done either by:\n",
      "\n",
      "taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse – this is common\n",
      "spending the night at the clinic – this is rare\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.\n",
      "The equipment you are given may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "a breathing sensor at your nose or mouth\n",
      "sensors to monitor your heart rate\n",
      "bands that are placed around your chest\n",
      "oxygen sensors that are put on your finger\n",
      "a small sensor that sticks on your chin\n",
      "\n",
      "The equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate, snoring, and body sleeping position through the night.\n",
      "If more information is needed, you may be asked to spend the night at the sleep centre.\n",
      "The main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography.\n",
      "During the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.\n",
      "Bands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.\n",
      "Different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "electroencephalography (EEG) – this monitors brain waves\n",
      "electromyography (EMG) – this monitors muscle tone\n",
      "recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen\n",
      "recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose\n",
      "pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels\n",
      "electrocardiography (ECG) – this monitors your heart\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound recording and video equipment may also be used.\n",
      "If OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA.\n",
      "Once the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend the right treatment.\n",
      "The severity of OSA is determined by how many breathing pauses you have per hour of sleep. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI).\n",
      "Severity is measured using the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "mild – an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour\n",
      "moderate – an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour\n",
      "severe – an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. Treatment is also most likely to help people who are very sleepy during the day. However, treatment may also help some people with mild OSA.\n",
      "There are treatments that can reduce the symptoms of OSA.\n",
      "Lifestyle changes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "losing weight\n",
      "stopping smoking\n",
      "cutting down on alcohol\n",
      "sleeping on your side\n",
      "avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tablets\n",
      "\n",
      "People with moderate to severe OSA usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. It delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask. This prevents your airway closing while you sleep.\n",
      "CPAP can feel peculiar to start with and you may be tempted to stop using it. But people who persevere usually soon get used to it and their symptoms improve significantly.\n",
      "CPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA. Telemonitoring may be used to check how well CPAP is working for you. Telemonitoring means healthcare professionals can check your use of CPAP therapy. They can see if there are any issues that they can help with and make adjustments where needed.\n",
      "As well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of complications of OSA in people who have symptoms, such as high blood pressure.\n",
      "Possible side effects of using a CPAP device can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "mask discomfort\n",
      "nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation\n",
      "difficulty breathing through your nose\n",
      "headaches and ear pain\n",
      "stomach pain and flatulence (wind)\n",
      "claustrophobia\n",
      "\n",
      "A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, like a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.\n",
      "They’re not generally recommended for more severe OSA. But they may be an option if a CPAP device isn’t right for you.\n",
      "A MAD is worn over your teeth when you’re asleep. It holds your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.\n",
      "It’s recommended you have a MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren’t always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.\n",
      "A MAD may not be a suitable treatment for you if you don’t have many – or any – teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, speak to your dentist to make sure they won’t be stressed or damaged by a MAD.\n",
      "Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically. For example, an enlarged tonsillar tissue. For most people surgery isn’t appropriate. It may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven’t helped.\n",
      "OSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.\n",
      "It can cause physical problems tiredness and headaches. It can also have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.\n",
      "Asthma + Lung UK and Sleep Apnoea Trust provide support and advice about living with OSA.\n",
      "Treatments can often help control the symptoms of OSA, but they’ll need to be lifelong in most cases.\n",
      "If OSA is left untreated, it can cause problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships.\n",
      "Poorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of:\n",
      "\n",
      "developing high blood pressure (hypertension)\n",
      "having a stroke or heart attack\n",
      "developing an irregular heartbeat – such as atrial fibrillation\n",
      "developing type 2 diabetes – although it’s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be more likely to be involved in a car accident. If you’re diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. You must inform the DVLA about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability.\n",

      "It’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren’t usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you’re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.\n",
      "The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:\n",
      "\n",
      "pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten\n",
      "unexpected weight loss\n",
      "jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured\n",
      "\n",
      "Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\n",
      "\n",
      "nausea and vomiting\n",
      "bowel changes\n",
      "fever and shivering\n",
      "indigestion\n",
      "blood clots\n",
      "\n",
      "You may also develop symptoms of diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\n",

      "Symptoms of Panic disorder:\n",
      "The symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.\n",
      "Symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.\n",
      "As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other symptoms, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\n",
      "sweating\n",
      "trembling\n",
      "hot flushes\n",
      "chills\n",

      "dry mouth\n",
      "a need to go to the toilet\n",
      "ringing in your ears \n",
      "a feeling of dread or a fear of dying\n",
      "a churning stomach\n",
      "a tingling sensation in your fingers\n",
      "shivering\n",
      "shaking\n",
      "\n",
      "The physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.\n",
      "For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which creates a cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic.\n",
      "Sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you’re having a heart attack.\n",
      "However, it’s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won’t result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don’t cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this ‘heart attack sensation’ and become more aware of how to control their symptoms.\n",
      "Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes. Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.\n",
      "People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.\n",
      "People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.\n",
      "If you have panic disorder, you may also feel anxious about when your next attack will be.\n",
      "During a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you’re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.\n",
      "This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.\n",

      "When your doctor examines you, they’ll look for tenderness in your pelvic region and an abnormal vaginal discharge.\n",
      "The doctor will usually take swabs from inside your vagina and cervix. These will be sent to a lab for analysis. However, a swab test can’t be relied on to diagnose PID, as some women with PID have a negative swab result.\n",
      "You may have an ultrasound scan. Scans can identify severe PID but will not show up mild disease. It’s possible to have a normal scan and still have PID.\n",

      "You can also get the infection from food or water that’s been contaminated with infected poo or droplets.\n",

      "There’s currently no cure for polio. Treatment focuses on supporting bodily functions and reducing the risk of long-term problems while the body fights off the infection.\n",
      "This can include bed rest in hospital, painkillers, breathing support and regular stretches or exercises to prevent problems with the muscles and joints.\n",

      "The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.\n",
      "Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of:\n",
      "\n",
      "flashbacks\n",

      "For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.\n",
      "Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.\n",
      "Many people with PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.\n",
      "Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.\n",
      "Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state of mind is known as hyperarousal.\n",
      "Hyperarousal often leads to:\n",

      "other physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches\n",
      "\n",
      "PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.\n",
      "PTSD can affect children as well as adults. Children with PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.\n",
      "Like adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches.\n",
      "However, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as:\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks.\n",
      "You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.\n",
      "Your GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They’ll ask whether you’ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you’ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.\n",

      "A grade 1 pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured – it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1 pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard.\n",
      "In grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.\n",
      "In grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.\n",
      "A grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.\n",

      "There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.\n",
      "Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.\n",
      "You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.\n",
      "This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed. \n",
      "This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.\n",
      "In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble.\n",
      "Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There’s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.\n",
      "This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.\n",
      "This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.\n",
      "Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.\n",
      "This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.\n",
      "This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.\n",
      "This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities.\n",
      "Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure, hypothermia and malnutrition.\n",

      "Symptoms of Pubic lice:\n",
      "It can take up to 3 weeks after coming into contact with pubic lice before you notice any symptoms.\n",
      "The most common symptom of pubic lice is itchy red spots. The itching is caused by an allergy to the lice saliva or poo.\n",
      "It can take 1 to 3 weeks for itching to develop after the first infestation, and it’ll usually be worse at night.\n",
      "Public lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour.\n",
      "They’re hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair. They live mostly on pubic hair, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on your head.\n",
      "You may also notice the following symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)\n",
      "white or yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)\n",

      "\n",
      "booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\n",
      "contacting your GP practice for an appointment\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no test for pubic lice. Your doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice. They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected.\n",
      "To help spot any pubic lice, your doctor or nurse may use a comb and a magnifying lens.\n",
      "You can also buy treatment over the counter at your local pharmacy although they will not be able to diagnose the infestation.\n",
      "Pubic lice are treated with medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.\n",
      "You’ll usually need to use treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You’ll need to repeat this a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.\n",
      "You may be asked to come back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic once you’ve finished treatment to check the treatment has worked.\n",
      "Your partner(s) should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms.\n",
      "Some pubic lice can be resistant to treatment. Resistance means that the lice will not be affected by a particular treatment. If your symptoms don’t settle, you may need to try more than one type of treatment.\n",
      "Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if your first treatment hasn’t worked.\n",
      "Treatment of lice in the eye area is usually different from elsewhere. Certain creams and lotions are not safe for use near the eye area. Lice here can be removed with tweezers or Vaseline can be used to suffocate the lice before removal.\n",
      "While you’re being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice from spreading.\n",
      "Pubic lice are spread through close body contact with someone who has them, most commonly sexual contact.\n",
      "The lice crawl from hair to hair but can’t fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally only leave the body to move from one person to another.\n",
      "Pubic lice don’t live on other animals such as cats or dogs.\n",
      "If you or your partner has pubic lice, you should avoid having sex (vaginal, anal or oral). You should also avoid close bodily contact. Do this until you’ve both finished treatment, including any follow-up treatment.\n",
      "Pubic lice are easily spread, and condoms don’t protect against them.\n",
      "To reduce the risk of getting pubic lice, you should limit the number of people you have intimate or sexual contact with.\n",

      "Symptoms of Restless legs syndrome:\n",
      "Restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs. It also causes an uncomfortable sensation in your legs, which can affect your arms, chest and face.\n",
      "This sensation has been described as:\n",
      "\n",
      "tingling, burning, itching or throbbing\n",
      "a ‘creepy-crawly’ feeling\n",
      "feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs\n",
      "a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves\n",
      "\n",
      "These unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable. They’re usually worse in the evening and during the night. The sensation can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.\n",
      "Some people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time, like on a long train journey.\n",
      "Up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\n",
      "If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.\n",
      "PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.\n",
      "There are two types of restless leg syndrome:\n",
      "\n",
      "primary or idiopathic restless legs syndrome\n",
      "secondary restless legs syndrome\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary restless legs syndrome makes up the majority of restless leg syndrome cases. In these cases, there’s no obvious cause of the syndrome.\n",
      "Some researchers think it may be caused by a problem with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. This part of the brain uses a neurotransmitter (chemical) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement. If the cells in your basal ganglia becomes damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This causes muscle spasms and involuntary movements.\n",
      "Dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day. This may explain why your symptoms are often worse in the evening and during the night.\n",
      "Research has also identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome. This means it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.\n",
      "Secondary restless legs syndrome occurs as a complication of another health condition. It can also be the result of another health-related factor.\n",
      "You can develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you have:\n",

      "\n",
      "where in the body the tumour started\n",
      "if it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child’s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using.\n",
      "Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.\n",
      "The 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments.\n",
      "Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given:\n",
      "\n",
      "to shrink the tumour before surgery\n",
      "after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back\n",
      "\n",
      "The drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.\n",
      "If it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.\n",
      "Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.\n",
      "The side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\n",
      "Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick, hair loss, tiredness, and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.\n",
      "Radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.\n",
      "A small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who’ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.\n",
      "Late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\n",
      "Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\n",
      "Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\n",
      "Before any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. If you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. You may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. You will then receive the best standard treatment available.\n",
      "Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\n",
      "After treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. After a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often.\n",
      "If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.\n",
      "As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\n",

      "Symptoms of Schizophrenia:\n",
      "Changes in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.\n",
      "The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories – positive or negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "positive symptoms – represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions\n",
      "negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent “phase”.\n",
      "People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.\n",
      "If you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.\n",
      "Read more information about how schizophrenia is diagnosed.\n",
      "A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.\n",
      "Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.\n",
      "Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.\n",
      "Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer’s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or one place in particular, such as the television.\n",
      "A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.\n",
      "Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.\n",
      "Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.\n",
      "Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.\n",
      "People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.\n",
      "People sometimes describe their thoughts as “misty” or “hazy” when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.\n",
      "A person’s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.\n",
      "Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.\n",
      "Another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.\n",
      "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.\n",
      "Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.\n",
      "It can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex \n",
      "lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns \n",
      "being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say\n",

      "You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\n",
      "A scan rarely changes how you manage the condition in the early stages. X-ray and MRI is generally not advised in people with sciatica. This is because structural changes of the spine are very common with age and often present in people who have no symptoms. \n",
      "A scan can be considered if your symptoms are unchanged for more than 12 weeks, continue to greatly impact your quality of life and you wish to consider surgery. Your healthcare professional can discuss this with you.  \n",

      "Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.\n",
      "Most people will recover from sciatica with a combination of time, modifying activity, and pacing themselves to allow the nerves to adapt. Pain medication, staying active, and gentle exercise will also help.\n",
      "The nerve can still be sensitive so it is recommended to build up your tolerance to activities slowly.  The little and often approach to movement is recommended.\n",
      "There are some things you can do to help manage this condition yourself.\n",
      "A back problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\n",
      "You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\n",
      "Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\n",

      "It’s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.\n",
      "Episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.\n",
      "Sickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks – others experience them less than once a year.\n",

      "Sickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.\n",
      "Sickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren’t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.\n",
      "As well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.\n",
      "Almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it’s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.\n",

      "\n",
      "if a baby’s parents weren’t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease\n",
      "if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not\n",
      "this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers here)\n",

You can still pass it on during the first year of this stage. After a couple of years, you can’t pass the infection to others, even though you remain infected. However, during this stage, the infection can be passed on from a mother to an unborn child during pregnancy.\n",

      "Find your nearest dentist\n",
      "It’s also important to have regular dental check-ups. Adults should have a check-up at least once every 2 years and children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year.\n",
      "Read more on getting over a fear of the dentist\n",
      "Treatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is.\n",
      "For early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.\n",
      "Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. This involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole.\n",
      "If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.\n",
      "If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture, bridge or implant.\n",

      "Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.\n",
      "Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.\n",
      "When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.\n",
      "If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.\n",
      "Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.\n",
      "Without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.\n",
      "The bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of abscess.\n",

      "Symptoms of Trigeminal neuralgia:\n",
      "The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.\n",
      "The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.\n",
      "Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.\n",
      "You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.\n",
      "After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.\n",
      "You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.\n",
      "Attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "talking\n",
      "smiling\n",
      "chewing\n",
      "brushing your teeth\n",

      "head movements\n",
      "vibrations, such as walking or a car journey\n",
      "\n",
      "However, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.\n",
      "Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.\n",
      "You may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.\n",
      "The emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression. During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide. Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.\n",
      "You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\n",
      "Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.\n",

      "As diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.\n",

      "Symptoms of Whooping cough:\n",
      "The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature.\n",
      "Intense coughing bouts start about a week later.\n",
      "The bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night.\n",
      "Coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting.\n",
      "Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath – this may cause a ‘whoop’ sound, although not everyone has this.\n",
      "The strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes.\n",
      "Young children’s skin can sometimes briefly turn dusky, blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing.\n",
      "In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing.\n",
      "The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely.\n",
      "Whooping cough can affect people of any age, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "babies and young children – young babies under 6 months of age are at a particularly increased risk of complications of whooping cough\n",
      "older children and adults – it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and frustrating\n",
      "people who’ve had whooping cough before – you’re not immune to whooping cough if you’ve had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around\n",
      "people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child – protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years\n",
      "\n",
      "You can get whooping cough if you come into close contact with someone with the infection.\n",
      "A person with whooping cough is infectious from about 6 days after they were infected – when they just have cold-like symptoms – until three weeks after the coughing bouts start.\n",
      "Antibiotic treatment can reduce the length of time someone is infectious.\n",
      "Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you’ve had the infection.\n",
      "Children under 6 months who are very ill and people with severe symptoms will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment.\n",
      "People diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of infection may be prescribed antibiotics to take at home. These will help stop the infection spreading to others, but may not reduce the symptoms.\n",
      "People who’ve had whooping cough for more than 3 weeks won’t normally need any specific treatment, as they’re no longer contagious and antibiotics are unlikely to help.\n",
      "While you’re recovering at home, it can help to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, clean away mucus and sick from your or your child’s mouth, and take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for a fever.\n",
      "Avoid using cough medicines, as they’re not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help.\n",
      "If you or your child are taking antibiotics for whooping cough, you need to be careful not to spread the infection to others.\n",
      "Other members of your household may also be given antibiotics and a dose of the whooping cough vaccine to stop them becoming infected.\n",
      "There are 3 routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough:\n",
      "\n",
      "the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy – this can protect your baby during the first few weeks of life; the best time to have it is soon after the 16th week of your pregnancy\n",
      "the 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age\n",
      "the 4-in-1 pre-school booster – offered to children by 3 years and 4 months\n",
      "\n",
      "These vaccines don’t offer lifelong protection from whooping cough, but they can help stop children getting it when they’re young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection.\n",
      "Older children and adults aren’t routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak.\n",
      "Babies and young children under 6 months are usually most severely affected by whooping cough.\n",
      "They’re at an increased risk of:\n",
      "\n",

      "The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer.\n",
      "Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.\n",

      "vaginal bleeding in between normal periods\n",
      "\n",
      "Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.\n",

      "tiredness\n",

      "Only 1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by womb cancer, so it’s unlikely your symptoms will be caused by this condition.\n",
      "However, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it’s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated. The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "endometriosis – where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb\n",
      "fibroids – non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus\n",

      "If you are trying to get pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your GP, practice nurse or travel clinic.\n",
      "It is recommended that women avoid unprotected sex and starting a pregnancy while travelling in an area with Zika virus. You should also avoid unprotected sex and starting a pregnancy for 8 weeks (if a woman) or 3 months (if a man) after you return home.\n",
      "Speak to your midwife or doctor for advice if you’re worried that your unborn baby may be affected by Zika virus. If you are still concerned after receiving assurances you can ask for counselling. Counselling can also be offered if you feel more stressed or anxious than usual.\n",
      "You should wait 28 days to donate blood after travelling to an area with Zika virus. These guidelines are set out by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.\n",
